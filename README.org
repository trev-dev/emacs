* My Emacs

This repository contains my Emacs init.  My goal is to keep my Emacs relatively simple and reasonably modular.  The goal was to go "lighter weight" as well but I still have something like [[file:lisp/td-packages.el][60 packages]] installed.  So much for that.

Anyway, here how things are laid out:
